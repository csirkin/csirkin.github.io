Last month I was at a customer's HQ when an all employee conference call was put on everybody's calendar with little more than an hours notice. The location was an external dial-in conference bridge. I got to sit with their IT staff as their outbound calling capacity was completely filled and their Internet utilization congested as everybody connected to the video stream and there was nothing anybody could do but wait till the meeting ended.

The impacts were predictable. Obviously nobody could make an outbound call, many people were frustrated that they couldn't connect to the meeting over the phone. The video stream was awful as round trip ping times pushed over a second. Fortunately the company had made sure that their ecommerce traffic was isolated from their corporate traffic so that wasn't impacted.

There's a better way to do this. First the company had an internal bridge that could have been utilized.
