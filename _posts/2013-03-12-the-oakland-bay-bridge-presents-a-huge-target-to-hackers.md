I was watching the video on ["The dazzling glory of San Francisco’s 25,000 LEDs—now on video"](http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/the-dazzling-glory-of-san-franciscos-25000-leds-now-on-video/#p3n) when I noticed where it says "Each LED is individually addressable over an Ethernet, copper wire, and fiber optic network". What a tempting prize to hackers. I'm really hoping that this is not available over any remote network, but I'm assuming it's connected somewhere. I guess it'll be fun to see if it gets hacked over the next two years.
