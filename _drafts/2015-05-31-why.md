For the past two and a half years I've been working as an independent consultant. June 1st I'm starting a job. Why?

I never set out to be an independent consultant. In fact, when I left [Juniper Networks](http://www.juniper.net) I was very explicit that I wasn't leaving to be an independent consultant. I intended to hire folks to work for my consulting company and ultimately there'd be enough of them that I would be able to make my living managing them.

I knew I was going the slow route. I didn't want to take on any debt and didn't look for any investors or partners, so initially the product of the company would be my time. Once I was making enough I'd be comfortable bringing on salaries. 

Over the past 2.5 years I've been able to stay busy enough. I've hit my financial goals. But I never hit the point when I was comfortable taking on responsibility for paying somebody else's salary.
It was more than a fear of not being able to meet my obligations, it was a fear that I might mess up somebody else's stability. I haven't been able to get comfortable with that idea. 

I tip my hat to all of you entrepreneurs out there who are able to take that step. I just don't want the burden. In my heart that's why I haven't described myself as an entrepreneur - I was just a guy who was willing to risk my salary, nothing else.

So I'll be starting a job as a consultant. If you are a current [Intrinsic Network Solutions](http://www.intrinsicns.com) customer I've probably told you already. If not, I apologize. I've tried to be very aware of my partnership agreements. If you need some help, reach out to me and I'll get you squared away. I'll be available at [Integration Partners](http://www.integrationpartners.com) at the beginning of the month.
